This module stores your opened sheets and it will reopen, resize, and re-arrange them after you reload or restart Foundry VTT.

## Installation

In the setup screen, use the URL `https://github.com/arcanistzed/persist-sheets/releases/latest/download/module.json` to install the module.

## Usage

No configuration necessary. In module settings, there's an option to disable auto-opening the sheets (if you are only interested in restoring position) and a button to reset all stored positioning data.
